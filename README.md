**Tools Used:** SQL, Python, Machine Learning.

**Tasks Performed:**
1. Established a predictive machine learning model to analyze the correlation between daily and dietary behaviors and obesity risk.
2. Undertook a detailed process of data analysis, collection, visualization, and extraction to discern lifestyle impacts on obesity, and implemented predictive modeling to estimate obesity likelihood based on these factors.
